'''This file is both a list of users, but also a place to safely practice getting some code from Github into Repl.it, making changes to it, and committing it back to the Github. A video tutorial and guide on the D2I website will accompany this file. To complete this task you'll need to pull this code from the D2I Github repository, change it by adding your name and LA to the dictionary below, then commit it back to the D2I repository, ready for one of us at D2I to accept the merge. This is the same workflow you'll be using to write validation rules!'''
