# D2I code library guide and terms of use

Welcome to the D2I code library! This is a space for children's services data professionals to share code or other data work which they think others may find useful. If you have comments or questions, please please get in touch via the D2I website (https://www.datatoinsight.org/collaboration).

Here on GitHub, separate repositories exist within the data-to-insight organisation (https://github.com/data-to-insight) which you can browse for things you might find useful in your own work. Our standard terms of use (see item 4 below) permit you to use and re-use these things within your local authority. For any other purpose, you must ask the author's permission unless they have provided for other such use under a specific stated license within the relevant repository.

Some repositories are "public", which means anyone can see them and make pull requests, though repository owners may retain control of the code therein. Other repositories are "private" which means they will not be visible except to members. A full list of private repositories is available to D2I members by email request, or by D2I Slack membership.

You can also contribute your work, and we encourage you to do so. We're happy to work with individual colleagues and/or teams to find the right ways to share work in each case, including agreeing who will manage the new repository and who can contribute to it. By sharing work via this space you agree to colleagues in other LAs using your work to support their own work, without cost, but also without warranty (see item 3 below).

There are, of course, a few rules:

1. Never include any sensitive or personal information in the code you share
      - This means you must check your code before sharing it for any hard-coded items which might disclose a person's identity

2. Never include any other organisation's protected intellectual property (IP) in the work you share
      - This means you must check you are authorised to share your work before you share it
      - If you wrote the work, this may be as straightforward as checking with your team manager for permission to share
      - In some cases, you or your manager may wish to check with your organisation's legal team that you are permitted to share work
      - In most cases, sharing work which includes the intellectual property of a third party would require that third party's permission
      - For example, we consider that sharing a software supplier's database schema without their permission would be prohibited, but that sharing SQL code you wrote to extract data from that database schema would probably be permissible

3. Assume no warranty of any kind
      - As per our standard terms of use, you understand that we provide our data tools and website content in the hope that these will be useful to others, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Should you find any faults in the data tools, you kindly agree to share details of these for the benefit of other members. Where a tool contains a specific License (usually on a separate visible tab, and usually an open source license) you agree to use the tool in accordance with the terms of that license.

4. By further accessing the D2I code library, you also agree to the standard D2I terms and conditions as outlined here: https://www.datatoinsight.org/terms-of-use
